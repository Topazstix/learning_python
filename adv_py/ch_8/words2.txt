positive
art
therapies
rock
beneficial
everyone
to

a

don't
believe

are
effective
for
CPTSD

an

I
found
the
sound
therapy
is
interesting
because
I'm
deaf
and
still
have
long
way
to
learning
about
my
hearing
knew
all
of
the
art

some
of
them
have
not
experienced
till
today
learned
about
the
physical
scientific
aspects
of
sound
therapy
learned
first
hand
how
fun
it
can
be
learned
could
be
used
with
traditional
therapy
more
relaxing
than
thought
learned
that
they
help
people
through
hard
times
embrace
their
inner
artist
and
capture
the
world
through
their
own
perspective
it
always
been
how
I
deal
with
mental
illness

be
relaxing
and
also
good
experience
to
learn
something
new

has
more
than
just
art
also
has
musical
and
harmony

was
really
interesting
