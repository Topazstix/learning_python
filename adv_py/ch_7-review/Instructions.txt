Daily dietary supplements are popular. Today, many companies make specialty supplements for men and women. Attached are two text files containing a list of vitamin levels within each supplement.

Write a Python program to read each text file. Determine differences between the vitamins and level of the two files. There can be two differences: 1) the level of a vitamin and  2) a vitamin in one and not the other.  Write the output to the screen aligned using format specifiers. The output should appear as:

THIS IS NOT A GROUP PROJECT THE WORK YOU SUBMIT SHOULD BE YOUR OWN

You must use a main() function along with at least two (2) other functions. Your program must contain a preamble, function comments as taught in the book and comments as necessary to explain its functionality.

Attach your finished program along with both text files in zip format to this link by the due date.
