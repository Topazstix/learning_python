# Learning Python
The following is a repository of programs written for an introduction to python programming course and its following advanced python course. The book for this coursework was `Python for Everyone` by `Cay Horstmann` and `Rance Necaise`, which you can find on your own. ~~The seven seas are wonderful for things like that.~~ 2nd Edition should work, 3rd Edition is what these were written from.


## Author's Notes
No text from assignments has been included (mostly), not all code will run or function out of the box, and some code may be missing. 

I've decided to upload this repository to help/show others the process I went through learning python. Start in the intro_py folder, and move through the chapters, then rinse and repeat for the adv_py folder. 

There are a few extra programs and folders/topics in the repo, which cover a few other topics I've learned about in python.
